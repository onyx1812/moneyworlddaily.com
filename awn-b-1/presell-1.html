        <h1 id="dynamic_title">Evidence Shows Dark Days Ahead, <br> <b>Government Insider Agrees…</b></h1>
        <h2>This former government insider’s latest prediction has people’s undivided attention</h2>
        <img src="./img/top.png" alt="" width="100%">
        <p>All evidence points to darker days for America and its citizens.</p>
        <p>From the effects of the Covid-19 catastrophe, to the failing confidence Americans are having in the national <a href="https://savingsscanner.org/click">election process</a>...</p>
        <p>Jim Rickards, the nation's Top Government Insider, couldn’t agree more.</p>
        <p>Spending nearly 40 years advising financial institutions, the US intelligence community, and correctly foreshadowing the 2008 <a href="https://savingsscanner.org/click">Financial Crisis...</a></p>
        <p>Rickards states he’s honestly never seen this level of chaos around the world. </p>
        <p>And because of what he’s seen transpire over the <a href="https://savingsscanner.org/click">past months</a>...</p>
        <p>He’s predicting that something 10 times more catastrophic than 2008 will happen to our economy in the coming days.</p>
        <p>Right now, Rickards is only one of few individuals speaking up about the specific dangers that could sweep across <a href="https://savingsscanner.org/click">our nation</a>...</p>
        <p>And it’s the very reason why he’s urging every American to follow this crucial 5-step process and protect their families from what’s to come. </p>
        <p>“Unfortunately, most Americans will ignore all the warning signs and will just hope for the best… And by the time they wake up to reality, it will be too late for them.” says Rickards.</p>
        <p>What he says next <a href="https://savingsscanner.org/click">is shocking</a>... and highly controversial.</p>
        <p>If you haven’t seen his chilling prediction <a href="https://savingsscanner.org/click">yet...</a></p>
        <p>Take a few moments to watch it below and see for yourself what’s at stake.</p>
