                    Every four years brings a new batch of federal laws that can radically change a person or business’ finances. From new regulations to a major shift in tax codes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next four years will be no different, and after four years of decreased regulations the next four years will see a spike in new laws, taxes and fees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With these new changes, Americans everywhere are looking for answers to how they should manage their finances to keep their profits and an answer is finally here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jim Rickards, one of the nation’s top financial minds, has a full presentation where he will show you everything you need to do to protect your savings, your investments, your retirement and the rest of your money.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Is Jim Rickards a Financial Guru?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jim Rickards is the creator of Rickard’s Strategic Intelligence Research Publication which is a detailed “Financial Game Plan” on how to make money during the next four years even if taxes, fees and rates go up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He actually testified before Congress on financial risks during the "Great Recession" and top leaders in government and Wall Street pay him tons of money for his opinions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But, you can learn his secrets for a fraction of that.
                </p>
                 <p>
                     <strong>A Changing American Economy</strong>
                 </p>
                <p>Look, the last year brought some of the biggest changes to our economy in more than 75 years. A global health crisis, unemployment in the United States hitting a record high of 14.7%, and the US had the highest rate and largest over-the-month increase in the history of the data (going back to 1948).</p>
                <p>2021 promises to be a much different situation, but with a new administration your taxes are most likely going to go up.</p>
                <p>Are your investments, mortgage, retirement and savings ready for the potential shakeup?</p>
                  <p>
                      <strong>A Winning Financial Blueprint</strong>
                  </p>
                <p>Jim Rickards has a long history of helping people protect their money and even make money during massive financial upheaval.</p>
