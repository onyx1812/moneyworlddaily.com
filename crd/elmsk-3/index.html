              BREAKING RIGHT NOW: Is Elon Musk Secretly Working With The U.S.
              Government To Schedule a MASSIVE Disruption to Your Internet
              Service on December 31st, 2020?
            </h1>
            <p class="text--md">
              I want you to take a look at the government document
              #:SAT-LOA-20170301...
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              Because this “hidden” government document gives Elon Musk the
              green light to schedule a MASSIVE disruption to your internet
              service…
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              To be clear, this isn’t just the next “ace” up any internet’s
              company’s marketing sleeve…
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">This is Elon’s full paradigm shift…</p>
            <p class="text--md">
              And it’s set to rip the floor out from the “old” internet...
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              And create a new “super” version of the internet that runs
              multiple times faster, at up to 90% less than what you’re
              currently paying.
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              Now, unless you scour the tech markets every waking moment of your
              life, it’s unlikely you’ve heard about this new partnership
              between Elon and the U.S Government
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              But it’s clear…
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              Elon’s new super-internet is coming — and it’s about to disrupt
              the $1.32 trillion Internet and Telecom markets…
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              And potentially make early investors up to 4,735% on their money,
              starting December 31st of this year!
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              I’ll show you exactly how the profits could play out in a moment.
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              But first, I want to be clear — it’s not just me talking about how
              exciting this new internet disruption could be…
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              The University College of London says… "this is the most exciting
              new [tech] we've seen in a long time..."
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              Business Insider reports… "the project could affect the lives of
              'potentially everybody."
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              And Bloomberg Businessweek reports..."[this is] Elon Musk's next
              big thing."
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              When you move FAST on what you’re about to read, I’m projecting
              profits of 95%... 948%... even 4,743% or more.
