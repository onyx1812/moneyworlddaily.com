              over the past years… that’s nearly 10x the stock market.

            Blogs. We may offer blogs featuring running commentary by popular

            commentary or to another subscriber's post. &nbsp;Access to some
            blogs may require a paid subscription to one of our premium
            services. We urge and encourage participants posting comments on the
            blogs to include their full name in any comment and to disclose any
            investments held in private company securities they discuss in any

            information obtained in these surveys is connected with individual
            subscribers and is used internally, participation is voluntary. In
            addition, some columnists will on occasion take polls of their
            readers. Such polls are solely for the editorial use of the
            individual columnists, and participation is voluntary.
