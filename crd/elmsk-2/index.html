              I want you to light a match under your last internet bill…
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              ... and count the seconds until it’s gone.
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              Because thanks to Elon Musk…
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">Beginning as soon as December 31st…</p>
            <p class="text--md">
              That’s how long it’ll take for the $1.32 trillion telecom industry
              to start going up in flames.
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              And when that happens, you could put yourself in position to:
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              Sweep those ashes from your overly-expensive internet bills into
              the trash, where they belong.
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              Pick up your monopoly-sized windfall (if you follow my simple
              guidance today).
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              And never rely on Comcast, Verizon, or Charter Cable for your
              frustratingly slow (and overpriced!) internet, ever again.
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              Which means, never push-buttoning through their awful automated
              phone service…
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              And never waiting three hours for the repair man to show up to
              repair your spotty connection...
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              Because the breakthrough Elon’s working on now could…
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              Beam you perfect internet wherever you are… at speeds 12x faster
              than you’re getting now… for what my estimates say could be as low
              as just $6.61 per month!
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              His “Super-Net” will instantly render every cable, TV, internet &
              phone service OBSOLETE…
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              Furthermore, just like all big tech revolutions, Elon’s latest
              project will instantly transfer billions of dollars of profits
              from old, inefficient industries…
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              Right into the pockets of the shareholders of Elon’s “Super-Net.”
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              The University College of London says… "this is the most exciting
              new [tech] we've seen in a long time..."
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              Business Insider reports… "the project could affect the lives of
              'potentially everybody."
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              And Bloomberg Businessweek reports..."[this is] Elon Musk's next
              big thing."
            </p>
            <p class="text--md">
              When you move FAST on what you’re about to read in this letter,
              I’m projecting profits of 95%... 948%... even 4,743% or more.
